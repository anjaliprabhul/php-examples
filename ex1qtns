1) Write a PHP code to remove duplicates in an array.

    [1, 9, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 10, 9]
    // Original array.

    [1, 3, 5, 9]
    // Original array transformed into a set.
do
2) Write a PHP code for Sum of an array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] 
    output - 30

3) Write a PHP code to find Highest number in an array
    [2, 10, 6, 5, 8] - output 10
do
4) Write a PHP code to find lowest number in an array
    [9, 4, 6, 2, 10] - output 2
do
5) Write a PHP function that converts hours into seconds.

6) Write a PHP code to find the position of the Highest number
    [20, 42, 10, 4, 90, 23, 45] - output 4
do
7) Given two strings, firstName and lastName, return a single string in the format "last, first".

8) Create a php function that takes two strings, $a and $b. Return the number of times the two strings contain the same two letters at the same index. The two letters must appear at consecutive indices.

    For example, if $a = "bboiizz" and $b = "bbuiiz", your function should return 3, since the "bb", "ii", and "iz" appear at the same place in both strings.


    $a = "bboiizz";
    $index = bb;

1) An array is special if every even index contains an even number and every odd index contains an odd number. Create a function that returns true if an array is special, and false otherwise.

([2, 7, 4, 9, 6, 1, 6, 3]) ➞ true
[2, 7, 9, 1, 6, 1, 6, 3]) ➞ false 3hr

2) Given two integers as arguments, create a function that finds the largest prime within the range of the two integers. 2hr

3) Given a string, reverse its order, change lowercase letters to uppercase and increment uppercase letters by one (e.g. A becomes B, C becomes D, Z becomes A).3hr

4) Your task is to create a Circle constructor that creates a circle with a radius provided by an argument. The circles constructed must have two getters getArea() (PI*r^2) and getPerimeter() (2*PI*r) which give both respective areas and perimeter (circumference).2hr

1. Given an array, write a function to calculate it's depth. Assume that a normal array has a depth of 1.

depth([1, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ 1

depth([1, [2, 3, 4]]) ➞ 2

depth([1, [2, [3, 4]]]) ➞ 3

depth([1, [2, [3, [4]]]]) ➞ 4

2) Given a letter, created a function which returns the nearest vowel to the letter. If two vowels are equidistant to the given letter, return the earlier vowel.
nearestVowel("b") ➞ "a"

nearestVowel("s") ➞ "u"

3) Create a function that takes two dates and returns the number of days between the first and second date.

getDays(
  new Date("June 14, 2019"),
  new Date("June 20, 2019")
) ➞ 6
